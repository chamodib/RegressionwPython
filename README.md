# Regression with R

Insurance Forecasting

This project was conducted with two other teammates and it aims to analyze a real life data set and use statistical methods to create a predictive model with given data. A data set from Kaggle on insurance forecasting was chosen, which provided certain patient information and their respective insurance costs. R programming language was used to clean, organize and analyze the data to create an accurate model to predict insurance costs based on patient information. 

The data set consisted of 1338 data points, with one response variable (charges) and six predictive variables (age, sex, bmi, children, smoker and region). The variables were a mix of numerical and categorical. 

To create an accurate predictive model, firstly some descriptive statistics were drawn to better understand the dataset. Secondly various variable selection methods such as forward, backward and stepwise regression along with LASSO regression was performed. Interaction terms were introduced and Box Cox variable transformation was used to transform the model to better fit the data. Finally cross validation was used to pick the best predictive model. RÂ² adj and root mean square error were used as measures to select the best predictive model.
